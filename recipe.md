1. To prepare this hotel style masala dosa, I have used idli-dosa rice. You can also use parboiled rice. In case you do not have idli rice or dosa rice, use any short grained rice like sona masuri. Even using regular rice like sona masuri or parmal rice gives crisp dosas.

2. Addition of thick poha (flattened rice) makes the dosa crisp and also makes it soft. So you get a crisp texture outside with a nice soft texture inside. I always add some thick poha to get this texture in masala dosa. Poha also helps in giving a golden color to the dosa.

3. Some chana dal is also added to make the dosa crisp and it gives a nice golden crust.

4. Methi seeds are added to aid the fermentation process. Methi seeds also give a nice taste to the masala dosa.

5. The proportion I use is 3:1 of the rice and lentils for making crisp dosas. In this masala dosa recipe I have used 1.5 cups dosa rice with ½ cup of urad dal. These recipe proportions yield crisp masala dosa, but one which is still soft. I use the same recipe proportions to make Ghee roast dosa.

6. The potato masala recipe shared here is truly restaurant style and tastes delicious with dosa. This potato masala or potato sabzi recipe is the way I make it. I add a lot of onions that impart a subtle sweet taste to the potato masala. Some soaked chana dal is also added. The taste of the potato masala is similar to the ones we get in hotels.




7. To get golden crisp dosa, the pan should be hot. But the flip side is that if the pan is very hot, then you cannot spread the batter nicely. Either sprinkle water on the pan and then wipe it. This brings down the temperature of the pan. Do this method on a cast iron pan. Don’t do this on a nonstick pan. It might affect the nonstick coating. Or you can heat the pan first, then reduce the flame to a low. Then spread the batter. Increase the flame to medium and then cook the dosa.

8. Also if using a nonstick pan than as soon as one dosa is done, reduce the flame. Spread the batter on the pan. Now increase the flame and let the dosa cook.

9. The batter has to be fermented well. if you live in a cold region, then keep the batter in a warm place or keep the batter for more time to ferment well.
